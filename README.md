# EVALUATION OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR REGRESSION AND CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS

By using HOUSING PRICE DATA, BANK LOAN DATA and CRIME DATA, The following machine learning alrgorithms were applied and evaluated. 

NOTE: Data mining techiniques were applied to the datasets before carrying out the model building and evaluation.

* Random Forest: Used for classification and regression problems.
* Support Vector Machines: Used for classification, regression, density estimation etc.
* Decision Trees: Used for classification and regression problems.
* Multiple Linear Regression: Used for regression problems.
* Na√Øve Bayes Classifier: Used for classification and regression problems.
* Logistic Regression: Used for classification problems.
